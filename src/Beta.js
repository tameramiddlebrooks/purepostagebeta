we’re currently testing a <strong>lightweight version</strong> of PurePostage with a small group of early partners. this beta focuses on digital shipping label generation and sustainability tracking, <strong>no fulfillment or live updates (yet!)</strong>. businesses will be able to request labels, view their order summary, & receive an emissions score based on each shipment.

<br></br>
<br></br>
<strong>here’s how it works:</strong>
<br></br>
<br></br>
	•	you’ll submit basic order info using our intake form.
    <br></br>
	•	we’ll generate and send you a digital shipping label.
    <br></br>
	•	you’ll receive a summary with sustainability data (estimated emissions and packaging usage).
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    your feedback will help shape the future of purepostage as we grow toward a full platform that puts sustainability and simplicity first.

                    <br></br><br></br> interested? get your business on the waitlist by heading over to the <a href="/waitlist">waitlist page</a>!

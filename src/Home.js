        <p> welcome to purepostage: a new kind of shipping platform designed to make online shopping more eco-friendly and less stressful for small business owners. while the full platform is still in development, we're currently inviting early partners to join our beta program to test a MVP version, and offer feedback on core features such as label generation and environmental tracking.
          this is just the beginning, and weâ€™d love your input as we build something better together.
